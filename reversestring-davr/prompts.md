## Prompts used to solve the problem. Using ChatGPT 4o

I turn to you because you're good at web programming.  I need to add some simple interactive functionality to an existing web page:
* a form field that allows me to enter a text, followed by a button with the text "Reverse!".
* When I click the button I want the web page to display the text in from the form field just below the field, but reversed, so that "asdf" becomes "fdsa", etc.
The existing web page reads JS from `script.js`, so please respond with two snippets, one for the html file and one for the js file.
