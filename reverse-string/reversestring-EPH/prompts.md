### Prompt:

Act as an experienced web developer with extensive knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I want you to make a small JavaScript application, which has an input where the user can enter any text he wants and the application should display the inverse of the entered text and display it in another box.

For example: if the user enters `AI4Devs`, it should return `sveD4IA`.

I want you to use this HTML file as a base:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

And add all the necessary JavaScript code to the “script.js” file.

I would also like you to use a nice and friendly interface, using a CSS library like Tailwindcss.
